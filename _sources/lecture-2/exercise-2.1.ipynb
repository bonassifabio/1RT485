    "- Plot 1 corresponds to an over-damped closed-loop response, as no oscillation is visible. This implies that the closed-loop poles are real-valued. Looking at the {ref}`fig:lec2:ex1:rlocus`, the closed-loop eigenvalues are negative real-valued for $0 < K \\leq 0.2$.\n",
    "- Plot 2 depicts an unstable and oscillatory closed-loop response, meaning that the closed-loop poles have a large imaginary part and a positive real part. From the {ref}`fig:lec2:ex1:rlocus` we can see that this is the case for $K > 11$.\n",
    "- Plot 3 depicts a marginally stable closed-loop response, i.e., the closed-loop poles have null real part. Therefore, this case corresponds to $K = 11$.\n",
    "- Plot 4 showns a stable, but oscillatory, closed-loop response. The  dominant closed-loop poles are complex conjugate. This case corresponds to $0.2 < K < 11$."
