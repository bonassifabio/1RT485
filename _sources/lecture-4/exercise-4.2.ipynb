    "3. **(Extra!)** Assume that the motor current can be measured. With the help of MATLAB, design a cascade control scheme for $G_2(s) = \\frac{Z(s)}{U(s)} = \\frac{1}{(1+sT)(1+sT_2)}$ and $G_1(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{Z(s)} = \\frac{10}{s(1+sT_1)}$, so that the phase margin is at least $60^\\circ$, and the bandwidth of the servomotr is at least $100$  rad/s."
